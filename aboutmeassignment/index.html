    <p>Hello, my name is Wesley Kolar. I am a 26 year old Veteran. I currently reside in Texas, but I spent most of my adult life living in San Diego, California.</p>
    <p> I served 7 years in the Navy as an Avionics Technician, which is a fancy name for an electrician that works on aircraft. I primarily worked on H60S helicopters, and I have done just about every job (not just the electronics side) you could possibly think of in relation to that type of helicopter.</p>
    <p>I am very new to coding, but it is something I have been interested in my entire life. I'm very excited to learn more!!!</p>
